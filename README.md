# Quest, another hobby operating system

boldly going somewhere many have gone before- and returned.

Quest is (going to be) a minimal hobby x86 operating system kernel written in C.

## Goals

- [ ] **Basic booting:** Kernel should boot from GRUB, load the initial program into memory, and begin execution at the kernel entry point
- [ ] **Text output on screen:** Kernel should display text on screen, handling basic escape sequences
- [ ] **Basic memory management:** Kernel should divide the system memory into pages, keep track of used and free pages, and allocate/deallocate pages when required
- [ ] **Interrupts and exceptions handling:** Kernel should be able to handle CPU interrupts, especially those generated by the PIC, error messages should be displayed on CPU exceptions
- [ ] **Keyboard input:** Kernel should and process basic ASCII input from the keyboard
- [ ] **Simple shell:** Kernel should include a basic shell that can interpret basic commands (help, poweroff, reboot)
- [ ] **Basic file system:** Kernel should implement a simple file system that supports basic operations such as creating, opening, reading from, writing to, and closing a file.
- [ ] **Process scheduler:** Kernel should be able to switch context between multiple tasks/processes based on a simple round-robin scheduling algorithm
- [ ] **Basic system calls:** Kernel should implement a minimal set of system calls to allow user programs to interact with it, such as requesting memory, IO operations, and process control
